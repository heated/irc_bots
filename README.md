irc_bots
========

Both bots utilize the [Node.js IRC](https://github.com/martynsmith/node-irc) library.

### LyricsBot
+ Uses [request](https://github.com/mikeal/request) and [cheerio](https://github.com/MatthewMueller/cheerio) to make HTTP requests and load HTML from page to parse for lyrics
+ Code needs to be refactored...

### RyanBot
+ Needs more functionality
